## Project Description
Homestead is a tool which facilitates access to community services for the homeless. 
It is also intended to inspire holistic self care, and self advocacy among those of 
the target population. Homestead is a resource with impact.  It promotes community  
unity as givers of assistance can connect directly with those in need.

Our application will contain mappable resources and the types of assistance offered by the agencies. 
Individuals will be able to search for an agency or browse through a list of agencies. 
An agency will be able to update their availability for supplies or beds and update any contact information.


 
## Intended Users
* Homeless individuals and families
* Municipal Health and Human Services agencies
