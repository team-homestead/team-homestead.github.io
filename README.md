## Project Description
Homestead is a powerful tool that facilitates access to community services for the homeless. 
It promotes holistic self care, and self advocacy among those of the target population 
while creating a platform for service providers to present the care they offer.
In fostering this community unity, Homestead proves itself a resource with impact.

The application allows consumers to search for local agencies or browse through a list of local 
agencies and their respective services offered.  An agency is able to update its list of available 
supplies, upcoming events and bed capacity.  Consumers are able to review agency listings in 
real-time, and map the shortest distance to what they need.  With every service experience, 
consumers can favorite an agency or event.



## Intended Users
* Homeless individuals and families
* Municipal Health and Human Services agencies
