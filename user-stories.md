## User Stories

* As a homeless individual, I want to find a shelter nearby so that I can have a meal and a bed for
 the night without having to go across town.

* As the director of the state Health and Human Services Department, I want to make sure that  
  access barriers to our agency resources are eliminated so that individuals in our community can 
  easily reach out to agencies for assistance.
