* I've been living on the streets for six years.  the worst part is having nothing to do but  
  wander all day long. I've heard the HOMESTEAD site has a bulletin-board that features  
  outreach events to homeless people.  I hope they have something for me.

* As the director of the state Health and Human Services Department, I need to make sure that  
  access barriers to our agency resources are eliminated.  Our reach to the homeless is  
  inconsistent.  The HOMESTEAD application puts or services in the hand of anyone with internet  
  access.
